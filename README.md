# Compass

An experimental project to recreate the [Mattermost Compass Design System](https://compass.mattermost.com/) components using AI-assisted development.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the capabilities of AI in generating React components from visual designs. Using [Aider](https://aider.chat/), components were generated by providing screenshots from the Compass Design System Figma designs as input.

The following components have been implemented:

- Button (with variants: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary, Link)
- Checkbox
- Chip (with variants: Filled, Outlined)
- Radio Button
