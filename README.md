# Compass

An experimental project to create the [Mattermost Compass Design System](https://compass.mattermost.com/) components using AI-assisted development.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the capabilities of AI in generating React components from visual designs. Using [Aider](https://aider.chat/), components were generated by providing screenshots from the Compass Design System Figma designs as input.

## Components

The following components have been implemented:

- Button (with variants: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary, Link)
- Checkbox
- Chip (with variants: Filled, Outlined)
- Radio Button
- Switch
- Text Input
- Text Area

Each component supports multiple sizes (Small, Medium, Large) and follows the Compass Design System specifications.

## Component Generation

The project includes a Fish shell script (`makecomponents.fish`) that automates the process of generating components from screenshots. The script uses Aider to process image files and create corresponding React components.

### Usage

```bash
# Run the script with your screenshots directory
./makecomponents.fish path/to/screenshots
```

The script will:
1. Process each image in the specified directory
2. Generate a new component based on the image filename
3. Add the component to the project's exports
4. Include the component in the test application

## Development

To get started with development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build the library
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## Future

Ideally this project could evolved into an automated pipeline for creating components from compass Figma designs. Perhaps with a Figma plugin we could get some better results by exporting all the required information.
